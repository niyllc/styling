## Styling Guide

This guide is for making the code more readable in projects. Every pull-request should fit these requirements. There is different guides for different languages. Please select the accurate and refactor your code.

### Why do we need these?

Every good code should be readable. We are adressing this problem by adding requirements so every code looks pretty. For example:

```html
<div class="TEXT_center COLOR-Red-light"></div>
<div class="text-center color-red-light"></div> 
```

Which one is more readable? Ofcourse the one on the bottom is! It has proper classnames and it looks better. The quality of the code is not only performance and speed, it is also the quality and the readability.

### How to access this guide

We are slowly writing this guide. You can access it through the Wiki and the folder named after the programming language. General concepts are in the folder named `shared`
